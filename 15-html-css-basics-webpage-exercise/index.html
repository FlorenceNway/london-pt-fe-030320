    <p style='font-family: "Caudex";'>Female programmers' suggestions for code changes in open source projects -- called "pull requests" -- were accepted more often than those of their male counterparts -- 78.7 percent for women versus 74.6 percent for men -- when gender was unspecified. However, that changed when the gender 
        of a pull request's author could be identified.
    </p>    
    <p style='font-family: "Caudex";'>
        Authors who could be identified by name or a profile picture as women had lower pull request acceptance rates (58 percent) than those who could be identified as men (61 percent).
    </p>
        
    <p style='font-family: "Caudex";'>
        On the other hand, women with gender-neutral profiles had higher acceptance rates (70 percent) than any other group, including men with gender-neutral profiles (65 percent).
